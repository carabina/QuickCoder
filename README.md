This project is based on the codebase of [Joan Lluch](https://github.com/John-Lluch) from the [HMIPad app](https://github.com/John-Lluch/HMIPad) project, where I ([Joan Martin](https://github.com/vilanovi)) used to work at before joining Mobile Jazz. This librarary was exquisite and now that the original code has been OpenSourced, I couldn't resist to take it, clean it and publish it.
